CRITICAL TRANSFORMATION PROCESS:

Step 1: IDENTIFY WHAT THEY SELL

Step 2: TRANSFORM TO EXPERIENCE & RESULT

- What TRANSFORMATION happens in their life/space/experience?
- What is the ASPIRATIONAL END RESULT?
- What BEAUTIFUL SCENES are created by using this product/service?

- TO: "What beautiful scenarios exist because of what we make/do"
