You are an expert in fine art stock photography search. Create a UNIQUE KEYWORD MIX for this specific article that combines unique concepts with intelligent variations of base keywords.

INPUTS:
Article Title: {{title}}
Unique Visual Concepts: {{unique_concepts}}
Campaign Base Keywords: {{keywords_images_base}}

CRITICAL OBJECTIVE:
Generate 10-15 keywords that will find VISUALLY DISTINCT images for this article while maintaining campaign coherence.
This article's images must look DIFFERENT from other articles, not repetitive.

INTELLIGENT MIXING STRATEGY:

DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS:
- 50-60% COMPLETELY UNIQUE keywords (based on unique concepts)
- 30-40% CREATIVE VARIATIONS of base keywords (NOT literal copies)
- 10% DIRECT REUSE of base keywords (only if perfect fit)

CATEGORY 1: UNIQUE KEYWORDS (50-60% of total, ~6-8 keywords)
Transform the unique concepts into specific search keywords:
- Directly implement the unique visual concepts identified
- Add specific details that ONLY apply to this title
- Create keywords that would find different images than other articles
- Pattern: Take concept + make it searchable + add fine art quality

Examples:
Concept: "Family living room atmosphere"
→ Keywords: "cozy family living space", "residential lounge gathering", "warm home interior moment"

Concept: "Vintage era styling details"
→ Keywords: "antique wedding decor", "retro celebration styling", "nostalgic romantic details"

CATEGORY 2: CREATIVE VARIATIONS (30-40%, ~4-5 keywords)
Take base keywords and TRANSFORM them to fit this specific article:
- DO NOT copy base keywords literally
- Add specific context from the title
- Use synonyms and related terms
- Adjust the focus/angle while keeping visual coherence

Examples:
Base: "sunlit interior design"
For living room article → "bright family room ambiance"
For bedroom article → "luminous sleeping space aesthetic"
For kitchen article → "daylit culinary interior"

Base: "romantic garden ceremony"
For vintage wedding → "nostalgic outdoor celebration"
For spring wedding → "botanical springtime union"
For rustic wedding → "countryside romantic gathering"

Base: "natural light architecture"
For panoramic windows → "expansive view architectural design"
For small spaces → "compact bright living architecture"

VARIATION TECHNIQUES:
1. Synonym Swap: "elegant" → "sophisticated", "refined", "polished"
2. Context Addition: "interior" → "residential interior", "living interior", "home interior"
3. Angle Shift: "celebration" → "gathering", "event", "occasion", "ceremony"
4. Specificity: "wedding styling" → "bridal detail styling", "reception tablescape", "ceremony arch design"
5. Mood Adjustment: "bright modern" → "airy contemporary", "luminous minimalist"

CATEGORY 3: DIRECT REUSE (10%, ~1-2 keywords maximum)
Only reuse base keywords if they are PERFECT and IRREPLACEABLE for this article:
- Use sparingly - maximum 1-2 keywords
- Only if no variation would work better
- Prioritize atmospheric/style keywords over subject keywords

Example - OK to reuse:
- "golden hour lighting" (timeless quality keyword)
- "fine art photography" (style descriptor)
- "soft natural light" (atmospheric quality)

Example - DON'T reuse literally:
- "modern living space" → Better: make specific to the article context
- "garden ceremony" → Better: add unique angle from this article
- "interior design" → Better: specify what kind of interior

FINE ART QUALITY ENFORCERS:
Ensure several keywords include these elements:
- Lighting quality: "golden hour", "soft natural", "ambient", "atmospheric"
- Photography style: "editorial", "fine art", "lifestyle", "contemporary"
- Aesthetic mood: "elegant", "sophisticated", "serene", "intimate", "luxurious"
- Composition: "detailed", "curated", "styled", "composed"

KEYWORD CONSTRUCTION PATTERNS:

Pattern A: [Unique Element] + [Fine Art Quality]
"vintage wedding decor details", "family living room elegance"

Pattern B: [Base Concept Variation] + [Article Context]
Base: "natural light interior" → "sunlit residential family space"
